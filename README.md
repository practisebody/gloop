##gloop

Everything hates OpenGL. You need to call magic functions to set color/size of some points and remember to set them back. Otherwise a line somewhere else will be accidently painted red!

Try this OOP style OpenGL library that wraps up everything as attributes, and never forget to set/unset something in OpenGL!
